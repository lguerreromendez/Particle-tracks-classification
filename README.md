# Particle tracks classification
## Analysis of the particle tracks detected by a MINIPIX detector, classified and visualized using PIXet Pro software

I have used the computer vision OpenCV module to analyze these videotracks and create an automated image track classifier

PIXet Pro software is utilized for the analysis of data from the MiniPIX detector. In this image, you can observe the screen where particle tracks are visualized, along with the classification performed by the software using an algorithm based on their position and energy
